# Cheap Yellow Display Example

This project is a [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) project with a modified version of the test program(s) for the Adafruit ILI9341 & touch library
applied to the ESP32-2432S028R board aka Cheap Yellow Display / CYD.

Sharing this as I had some initial hurdles getting this board to run with thse standard libraries

## Dependencies

The dependencies are automatically resolved via [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/)

	adafruit/Adafruit GFX Library@^1.11.9
	adafruit/Adafruit ILI9341@^1.6.0
	https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/XPT2046_Touchscreen.git

Note: use the latest version of the XPT2046_Touchscreen library, the build-in version in PlatformIO is long outdated.


## How to get the XPT2046 and ILI9341 working
Key elements to get it working:

Use 2 SPI classes:

```
SPIClass hspi = SPIClass(HSPI);
SPIClass vspi = SPIClass(VSPI);
```

Initializes the touchscreen while passing the SPI Class:

`Adafruit_ILI9341 tft = Adafruit_ILI9341(&hspi, TFT_DC, TFT_CS, TFT_RST);`

Setup the VSPI to use custom pins for the touch and pass it in the tf.begin():
  
```
vspi.begin(XPT2046_CLK, XPT2046_MISO, XPT2046_MOSI, XPT2046_CS);
ts.begin(vspi);
```
